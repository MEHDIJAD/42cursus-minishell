ok thank you now i added what you gave me and some of the tests are done fine and some problm are fixed and some not fixed and some are new
and now i want you to fix them and give me the fixes and why based on the tests i have done i included my code as well 

ok for some of the test that failing in are 

1/ if i added many ctl +c it works fine but when i do ctl +d the first ctl +d it not work accept it as ctl +c but the second it works and this is in 
only one case if added many ctl +c before ctl +d "it get accepted untill the second ctl +d "
2/ the status of the parent in ctl +c not 130 but it is 0 
3/ in clt +c whith txt buffer not work it work give new prompt but keep the txt type at the beginning note
exampele in ctl +c keep the same commands
"
minishell$ ls
minishell$ ls
minishell$ ls
minishell$ ls
minishell$ ls

"
and staus also not 130 of course 

NOTE: i heard that some of the ansi escape that reset the line or something like that "/r/033/2K/033[1A"
if you know more about it you can tell me about it or use it 

4/ for exit it print exit in newline how to fix it as well like this 
 minishell$ 
exit


and for the Heredoc are
----
minishell$ cat << EOF
> 

[Heredoc processing failed or interrupted]
minishell$ 
exit
bash-3.2$ 

for example the above i typed ctl + c and get me out of the minishlle when type ctl + c exited from all minishell 
and the problm after that in bash the commands i typed not shoes in terminal and bash become lagging little bit untill i ctl + D

----
and this test as well 

minishell$ cat << EOF | wc -l
> as
> df
> asdf
> asd
> f
> 
[Heredoc processing failed or interrupted]
minishell$ 
exit
------
