/*
When you run:

```bash
echo "asdfsaf " >> a | echo "asdfsaf " >> a | ‚Ä¶ 
```

in **bash**, each `echo` writes to the file (`>> a`), then immediately exits, flushing its newline‚Äëterminated output. Because bash‚Äôs `echo` is a **builtin**, it calls `write(2)` (or does an `fflush`) before returning, so you see one neat line per invocation.

In your **minishell**, your `ft_echo` uses `ft_putstr_fd` and `ft_putchar_fd` over `STDOUT_FILENO`, and then returns. When `stdout` is **not** a terminal (i.e. when it‚Äôs redirected into a file), the C library switches to **block buffering**, meaning it accumulates up to, say, 4‚ÄØKiB before actually writing. If you‚Äôve only output 8 bytes plus newline, it sits in the buffer until:

* The buffer fills, or
* You explicitly flush, or
* The process exits **cleanly** via `exit(‚Ä¶)`, which flushes all stdio buffers.

But in a long pipeline with many echoes, the child processes may *exit in ways that bypass the normal `exit()` cleanup*, or your `fork_and_exec_child` might call `_exit()` (which does *not* flush stdio). That leaves partial buffers unwritten or written in chunks, leading to the garbled, ‚Äúchunky‚Äù file contents you saw.

---

## ‚úÖ How to fix it

### 1. Force line buffering on `stdout` when it‚Äôs not a terminal

At the very start of your `main()` (or after `setvbuf` calls), add:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp)
{
    
     * Make stdout line‚Äëbuffered even when not connected
     * to a terminal. That way every newline causes a flush.
     
    setvbuf(stdout, NULL, _IOLBF, 0);
    ‚Ä¶
}
```

* `_IOLBF` = line‚Äëbuffered
* Every `ft_putchar_fd('\n', STDOUT_FILENO)` now triggers a flush of the current line.

### 2. Explicitly flush after your echo

In `ft_echo`, after you‚Äôve printed your final newline, call:

```c
fflush(stdout);
```

so that even if you use `_exit()` in child processes, the parent‚Äôs stdio buffer has been flushed.

### 3. Or bypass stdio entirely

Instead of `ft_putstr_fd`/`ft_putchar_fd`, write directly:

```c
write(STDOUT_FILENO, cmd->argv[i], strlen(cmd->argv[i]));
if (!cmd->argv[i+1]) write(STDOUT_FILENO, "\n", 1);
```

`write(2)` is unbuffered, so there‚Äôs no stdio buffering issue.

---

### **Why ‚Äúunder the hood‚Äù this matters**

* **`exit()` vs `_exit()`**

  * `exit()` flushes stdio buffers then calls `_exit()`.
  * `_exit()` jumps straight to kernel without flushing C library buffers.
* **Child processes** in pipelines often use `_exit()`. If your `echo` logic runs in a forked child that does `_exit()` after printing, any buffered data is lost.
* By forcing **line buffering** or calling `fflush()`, you guarantee every line is sent to the OS immediately‚Äîeven if the process then uses `_exit()`.

---

**In summary:**

* **Line‚Äëbuffer** `stdout` with `setvbuf`
* **OR** explicitly call `fflush(stdout)` after printing
* **OR** use `write(2)` directly

This will make your echoes behave just like bash‚Äôs, producing exactly one line per `echo` in the file every time‚Äîno more garbled or delayed output.

/*
Echo in Bash is implemented entirely as a shell‚ÄØbuiltin written in C; it does **not** allocate any heap memory for its own operation. All of its state and temporary data live either in static buffers within the shell or on the C call stack. It parses its arguments, decides whether to print a trailing newline (the `-n` option), and then writes the concatenated string out‚Äîall without calling `malloc` or otherwise touching the heap ([GNU][1]).

Under the covers, Bash‚Äôs built‚Äëin I/O uses low‚Äëlevel write calls (or its own tiny wrappers around `write(2)`) rather than the higher‚Äëlevel `printf`/`puts` stdio layer. This means built‚Äëins like `echo` bypass the standard C library‚Äôs buffering altogether, writing straight to the file descriptor for `stdout` (or whatever you‚Äôve redirected it to). Because they use `write(2)`, there is no dependency on stdio buffers for correctness or performance ([Stack Overflow][2]).

By contrast, if you invoke the **external** `/bin/echo` program, you‚Äôre running a separate process whose C runtime **does** use stdio buffering. On most systems:

* **`stdout` is line‚Äëbuffered** when connected to a terminal (data is flushed on each newline).
* **`stdout` is fully buffered** when redirected to a file or a pipe (data is flushed only when the buffer fills or when the process exits) ([GNU][3]).

You can even control that buffering in user code with `setvbuf` or `setlinebuf` if you write your own C program, but Bash‚Äôs built‚Äëins don‚Äôt need to worry about it‚Äîthey rely on direct `write` instead of `fwrite` or `fprintf`.

**Summary**

* **Heap vs. Stack**: Bash‚Äôs `echo` uses no heap memory; all its temporaries reside on the stack or in static storage.
* **Buffering**: Because it writes directly via `write(2)`, the builtin isn‚Äôt subject to stdio buffering rules at all. If you run `/bin/echo`, then the C library‚Äôs stdout buffer behavior (line‚Äë vs. full‚Äë buffering) applies.
* **Practical impact**: You get atomic, unbuffered writes from the builtin, and you avoid any risk of buffering anomalies when piping or redirecting in scripts.

Below is how you can **defend** that your `ft_echo` never uses the heap, only stack, and that it behaves correctly without relying on any stdio buffering:

---

## 1. No Heap Allocation in Your `ft_echo`

Your implementation of `ft_echo` uses only:

* **Local integer variables** (`flag_print_newline`, `start_index`, `i`)
* **Calls** to `ft_putstr_fd` and `ft_putchar_fd`, which internally do unbuffered `write(2)` calls

You **never** call `malloc`, `calloc`, or any other heap allocator in `ft_echo`, so **all** of your function‚Äôs data lives on the **call stack** üå©. As soon as `ft_echo` returns, its stack frame is torn down‚Äîno leaks, no heap garbage.

---

## 2. Built‚Äëin `echo` in Bash Also Avoids the Heap

* The **Bash** builtin `echo` is implemented entirely in C within the shell, reusing static or stack‚Äêallocated buffers‚Äîand it issues direct `write(2)` system calls rather than invoking the stdio layer ([The Linux Documentation Project][1]).
* There is **no** dynamic allocation (`malloc`) in Bash‚Äôs `echo`; temporary strings are built in fixed buffers or on the C call stack.

---

## 3. Direct `write(2)` Bypasses stdio Buffering

* The POSIX **`write`** system call writes bytes from a user‚Äêsupplied buffer directly to a file descriptor, with no involvement of `FILE*` or stdio buffering ([Wikipedia][2]).
* By using `write(2)` (as your `ft_putstr_fd` and `ft_putchar_fd` wrappers do), each chunk is sent immediately to the kernel, with **no** C‚Äëlibrary buffering.

---

## 4. Why Heap or stdio Buffers Would Be Problematic

1. **Heap allocations** in a simple shell builtin risk:

   * **Memory leaks** if you forget to `free`.
   * **Performance** overhead for every `echo`, which matters in pipelines.

2. **Full stdio buffering** (the default when `stdout` is redirected):

   * Data may remain in user‚Äëspace buffers until they fill (commonly 8‚ÄØKiB), or only be flushed on a normal `exit()`‚Äîbut many shells use `_exit()` in child processes, skipping cleanup.
   * This leads to partial or missing lines in redirected output, exactly the ‚Äúgarbled‚Äù results you observed.

By contrast, your direct‚Äêwrite approach‚Äîjust like Bash‚Äôs builtin‚Äîhas **no buffering anomalies** and **no heap** involvement.

**In summary**, your `ft_echo` lives entirely on the stack and does one unbuffered `write(2)` per argument (plus spaces/newline). This mirrors Bash‚Äôs own builtin design: no heap, no stdio buffering, and thus no risk of partial output or memory leaks.
